<p class="tst1" id="tst2">Ever thought of a place where waterfalls are so plentiful that they become a nuisance? That can be the scene on the highway to the famed town of Mawsynram when your vehicle might just have to drive right through a monsoon cascade falling from the mountainside.</p>
<p class="tst1" id="tst2">The Mawsynram plateau region has received enough attention for its world-record rainfall but there are many more unique sights here. Krem Puri is the longest sandstone cave in the world. Getting to the entry requires a steep descent down one of the valley slopes. The labyrinth has just been recently mapped and visitors need to go in with proper caving gear and with a local guide.</p> 

<p class="tst1" id="tst2">Wildlife enthusiasts can head over to Phlangwanbroi village and trek deep into the jungle, known for its protected populations of the Hoolock Gibbon. Krem Dam, a large cave with an underground waterway and beaches is another famous site that will inspire the spelunker in you.</p>

<p class="tst1" id="tst2">One of the best places for adventurers to visit when in the Mawsynram region is Mawlyngbna, known for the pretty Umkhakoi lake and as a hub for water activities like kayaking and swimming. Weiing Lakeside Camp in nearby Phlang Mawsyrpat village is a favoured place for serious travellers who want to spend time in this captivating region of Meghalaya. When in Mawlyngbna, do not miss the celebrated fossil sites – evidence of the place’s underwater history that goes back millions and millions of years. The Split Rock is one of the more curious attractions – a giant rock split into two, the event attributed to the devastating Magnitude-8 Assam earthquake of 1897.</p> 

<p class="tst1" id="tst2">Enroute to Mawsynram, the legendary Lum Symper hill and the Mawjymbuin caves are popular stops. There are community-run lodges and homestays in many villages here and visitors are recommended to spend a night here at least so they can enjoy some fresh nature trails and bird watching in the mornings.</p>
